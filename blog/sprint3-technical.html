    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS are like the differences between a builder and a interior designer. The builders job is to 
        lay the foundations of the huose and make the walls, ceiling, and roof. Once this is done, the interior designer can come in and decorate the interior space.
        Like this example, HTML acts as the foundations to CSS as a form of styling the foundations of a website.

    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those ones)</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        <strong>Control Flow</strong> - is the order that instructions, statements, or functions are executed in. An everyday life example of control flow can be like washing your
        hands before eating. Deeper still, it can also be a set of instructions of how to effectivly wash your hands. <br> 
        <br>
      <strong>Loops</strong> - are a quick and easy way to do 
        something repeatedly. An everyday example of loops could be relating back to the last example of washing your hands before dinner but after finishing washing your hands, 
        repeating that task over and over again in a loop until the loop is exited when meeting a designated condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                   .

    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
      The DOM or 'Document Object Model' is an application programming interface (API) for manipulating HTML and XML documents. An example of how you might interact with it is by 
      grabing HTML elements/attributes from the DOM. You can run commands like 'document.URL' to return the URL of the website or 'document.getElementsById()'
      which will get elements based on the Id thats passed. In simple terms, the DOM is what makes webpages interactive allowing the user to change the content, styling or
      layout of your page within javascript. An example of when you may find yourself using the DOM is when you are wanting something interactive on your page eg. a game.

    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
      <strong>Objects</strong> are used when representing one 'thing'. This can be for example a person or item, moreso singular. Anything made up or has a set of 
      characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called properties that have a key and value. This could be used to describe a building with properties 
      like - townhouse, three story, white, weatherboard, tile roof. 
      <br>  
      <br>
      <strong>Arrays</strong> create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. They are useful for creating ordered collections where these items 
      can be accessed in its numerical hierarhy within that list. Essentially it is a set of values relating to one or the same thing like when writing a list of 
      items to be collected from a store or shop - within the list, you can create loops functiions to track down a specific item in the list. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
      Functions are a key componant to javascript and is a procedure that has a set of statements that perform a task or calculate a value. It allows you to define 
      a section of code, give it a name and then execute it as desired. Functions are useful because they simplify code making it easier to understand. It allows us
      to create a function as a stand alone entity and pass it as an argument to a method. This eliminates the need to rewrite code repeatedly.
