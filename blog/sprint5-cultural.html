    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        The way I react to doing something new and different that im not use to both for myself and when around others. I feel the pressure 
        when someone is depending on me, for example: when we did the looping exercise, I felt the pressure if I was going to be able to recall 
        everything being said within the 2 minutes. Because of that I missed some key things. <br>
        <br>
        How I feel when a share my work with others. I like to see what others have done to try and be similar or make sure im on the right 
        track. I like to compare myself to others a lot to ensure there isn’t much discrepancy between what is ‘normal’ and what isn’t.<br> 
        <br>
        Ways in which I react when I hit a problem which I can’t resolve, release the stress, and then come back to the same problem again 
        and use my problem solving skills to tackle the issue through process of elimination of different problem solving techniques.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        I think all three of these personal components sum up a lot of what represents a person and how they deal with things that effect 
        themselves and others. I feel a lot of what is within ones values, empathy, and self awareness forms the foundation of a person. 
        If can effect ones motivation to learning or even in programming if they don’t have the right self awareness or values. Another 
        example is empathy and this can be a big component to working with others and how others can be effected. Throughout the core exercises, 
        they have made me aware to these aspects and how they link into being a developer over just having the technical skills. With what I 
        have already established and continually  identifying/adapting  what these are/mean to me (values, empathy, self awareness) throughout 
        the EDA course and my career, is going to be paramount to my success as a developer. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        My view on becoming a developer has always been seen as knowing the technical knowledge/language. There has not been any regard to 
        aspects covered in the core exercises. The surprising factor for me is the importance to these aspects that make a successful, 
        long-lasting modern-day developer. But throughout these aspects the most surprising aspect has been learning about myself and looking 
        deeper into the way I react/respond to situations and then approaching a response. This has meant an incredible amount of learning 
        about myself and not just as a developer but as a person in general. A lot of the things learnt about myself are applicable throughout 
        any aspects of life.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        The most challenging aspect for me was learning without direct guidance where someone is physically there to explain to me face to 
        face and in the moment, when all has come to a stand still, facing a problem. These challenges were mostly faced during sprints 4/5. 
        It required a great deal of persistence and learnings from the core exercises to keep going and working a solution to not having the 
        direct guidance.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        Because, the ideology of a modern-day developer is changing as we go into the future where group work is more and more common and 
        being able to take a step back, understand the way that our mind/emotions work, and then executing a response is going to be a key 
        component to becoming a successful developer. Core skills allows an individual to look at ones self, understand how they work, make 
        changes where necessary and then come through with a response to any situation. This is my biggest and overall take-away from the 
        core learning and  how I perceive this aspect of foundations. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        At the very beginning, it did feel like a big waste of time and I felt a sense of annoyance when I had to complete these activities 
        part of core. It was difficult to talk about myself throughout these activities and a lot of me didn’t want to part take in them. 
        But it was my mindset and values that keep reminding myself that this was required as part of learning and there was a big element of 
        trust that I would be learning this as EDA(the experts) thought it was important to learn as a developer. Overall and coming to the end 
        of foundations, I now can connect the dots and see its value and importance as a developer for problem solving, dealing with my own 
        emotions, dealing with others around me and understanding what defines me as things to come to mind. There are probably a whole lot more 
        things that have come form core which iv missed. But I think a lot of this learning and also what is to learn through bootcamp, will put 
        me at an advantage.

    <p class="content-paragraph">
        Ideally, id like to build a long lasting career out of my learnings from EDA. Initially I see myself working under an employer to 
        start off with, while I build experience within the industry. Once I feel I am confident I would like to start my own independent 
        work which could be alongside part time work under an employer and then transitioning to fully independent work. Thereafter id 
        ideally like to have a team of developers working under me where I am solely the person sourcing the work for a team of developers.

        I feel my strengths and limitations haven’t changed a great deal since sprint 2. However I feel I know more about my strengths and 
        limitations since I established them a few weeks ago.  I am better at problem solving and at understanding my self as a person - 
        how I react to certain things and how I deal with difficult situations, what helps me relieve stress, and now having developed a way 
        of problem solving. More so I think my focus has been more on the limitations, to find ways for those limitations not to be a hinderance. 
        I still feel what I mentioned is sprint 2 is still relevant but moving forward from there has been more about learning those obstacles to 
        better understand how to overcome them.

    <p class="content-paragraph">
        Definitely, speaking in-front of a large group of people is something that I have always struggled with and I feel this is going to 
        be somethings that may come up in bootcamp as a non technical challenge for me. I do also find myself being easily distracted as I 
        get more and more comfortable with my working environment. So being self aware of myself for distractions where they are likely to 
        bring me down is going to be an important challenge for me. However distractions are somethings healthy for me when used correctly. 
        Another challenge is going to be, working within time allocations for each aspect and if having major issues with something, to ask 
        for help or problem solving  rather than going around in circles. But more so for me, when things go right, sometimes I can get caught 
        up in perfecting (design) aspects so having self control and knowing where to draw the line is going to be important.

        Id really like to learn how to effectively present work specific to this career - how things are presented both verbally and visually. 
        I feel like id really like to make sure that I have got time management on the lock down by the time iv finished bootcamp so that I 
        don’t have issues with time management when in the work force. I want to make sure that I don’t make others problems my problem keeping 
        my interested at the forefront. At times I get shy or scared of asking questions, I want to be able to be confident when I don’t know 
        something, not to be afraid to ask in-front of a group setting  or one on one. At times I get scared of what others will think of me so 
        id like to get over this. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <p class="content-paragraph">
        I want to keep on top of all work and assignments making sure that I don’t fall behind on any work or have to pull all nighters which 
        are like a downward cycle. I feel like it’s important for me to keep on top of moments where I get stuck to not pretend like I know 
        what I’m doing rather not be afraid of asking for help or not being afraid of looking dumb. Id like to keep a regular journal and make 
        at least one note about my day. If I get time id like to make more notes revising what iv learnt that day. I think its also important 
        that I commit more than just the class times to coding and the assignments.
