    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        Understanding neuroplasticity principles can benefit people  in a way that they are more aware of the effects of this concept which 
        in-tern means that people are more likely to be motivated to keep at ‘practise’ or learning new things,  even through difficulties. 
        Someone who understands, that this concept of learning has been studied and proven to work, are more likely to be motivated and convinced 
        that “if I keep at it even though its hard, I can master anything I am trying to achieve” - helping them achieve what that desire to achieve.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        How I see myself engaging with neuroplasticity principals for my own benefit would be when I feel like I have spare or free time, 
        I see myself doing activities that may interest me that I don’t normally do. I would like to utilise this free time to 
        continue learning new skills to encourage neuroplasticity and to also motivate me to learn new skills or even skills I have shied  
        away from due to lack in confidence or inability. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        Neuroplasticity can be increased by doing creative tasks like reading fictional books, learning an instrument,  intermittent fasting, 
        travelling to new places, non-dominant hand exercises, expanding vocabulary, creating artwork and dancing to name a few. These from my 
        research are known to enhance or boost neuroplasticity.

    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Growth Mindset</strong></h1>
    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Discuss Growth Mindset, what it is, and why it is relevant</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        Growth Mindset is a positive way of thinking and self belief of a standard - ‘Growth’. People with a growth mindset genuinely believe 
        they can get smarter, more intelligent and more talented through time and effort.  However in comparison, someone with a fixed mindset 
        believe that ‘you either have it or you don’t’. These people place themselves at a benchmark and blame the rest on chance/luck. Growth 
        mindset is relevant because it will greatly impact how well we can keep ourselves motivated throughout this journey of learning coding. 
        If we are prepared to accept that through time and effort we are likely to succeed at becoming web developers, we will grow into such 
        belief. With the fixed mindset, chances are that person probably didn’t even sign up if they didn’t think they were capable. Fixed 
        mindset people are likely to be left disadvantaged to new opportunities due to their fixed ways.

    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        Yes, that both Neuroplasticity	and growth mindset are highly relatable to what I am doing right now at EDA and can be applied very 
        directly to the course and other forms of my life. As well as this, both the topics go hand in hand. If you’re likely to have a growth 
        mindset, you’re going to be more like to try new activities which can grow Neuroplasticity. If you’re practicing neuroplasticity, 
        chances are you have a growth mindset to a certain degree opening yourself to learning new skills/talent. 
    </p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        I will Integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey by using positive regard to encourage myself when I feel like I am 
        struggling with something and not giving up. I think its important to continually remind myself of having the growth mindset and 
        that I am capable through time and effort. Difficulties  are merely a challenge to grow stronger faster and develop deeper meaning 
        and understanding of the difficulty.
