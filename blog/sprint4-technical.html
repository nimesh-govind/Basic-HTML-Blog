    <p class="content-paragraph">
        I once got blocked on a simple problem when I was writing the code for an exercise, after writing the code, I got an error message 
        and just couldn’t seem to get past it no matter what I tried. Every time I tired a different solution, I was getting more and more 
        frustrated as it came back with an error. I gave up and took the dog for a walk instead to freshen my mind. As much as I didn’t want 
        to  I knew it was now time to have another crack as I had calmed down. I looked at the error and looked at the code and back and 
        forth multiple times. I could tell something wasn’t right but it was a matter of figuring it out. Then BOOM it hit me I had spelt 
        part of a code incorrect and therefore no matter whatever other changes I had made to get it to work, with an incorrectly spelt part 
        of the code, it wasn’t going to work. I felt extremely dumb but I will never forget this moment again.  I am now learning to take a 
        deep breath when I see error codes and if I feel myself get more and more frustrated, then to walk away from the screen, have a 
        change in activity and then come back and try again with a fresh mind. Im more likely to work more efficiently this way and be more 
        successful, quicker. <br>
        <br>
        Then I was doing an exercise there were lots of moments where I just didn’t know where to start or how to start and also moments
        where id get to a certain point and then not know how proceed. Id know how to explain what I needed to do verbally but writing the 
        code was a problem. I broke the problem to the smallest component as possible and if I still didn’t know I started googling (because 
        its easier to research small components vs big ones). If it was a task that was repeated, then I would figure out one component and 
        that would then help me for the other parts where the same code is used and adapted slightly. Eventually piecing the puzzle back into 
        its whole form, bit by bit, I was able to complete the exercise. What helped me achieved the above was by planning out the whole code 
        from the start in words which meant i could then use words to research online.

    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong></h1>    
    <br>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
    <u>Pseudocode-</u><br>
    This worked really well for me and was a means of helping me research issues. It helped me come up with a plan for writing the code. 
    It helped me understand what I am trying to achieve before getting stuck in.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        <u>Trying something-</u>T<br>
        This was the biggest step of all was to take a leap of faith and try. If I tried too many times though without success, I start 
        getting frustrated. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        <u>Rubber ducky method-</u><br>
        Hmm, I didn’t really use this method but definitely something id like to try.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        <u>Reading error messages-</u><br>
        This one was the biggest learning curve for me not to freak out/get frustrated by error codes but to read and interpret them and 
        use them to identify issues with your code. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        <u>Console.logging-</u><br>
        This helped me get a good indication on if I was making progress in the right direction or not. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        <u>Googling-</u><br>
        This is my most confident one and works most of the time to get my solution. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        <u>Asking your peers for help-</u><br>
        This was really good for the times that online wasn’t able to help although sometimes the way that things are explained can make a 
        difference.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        <u>Asking coaches for help-</u><br>
        This helped when there was real self doubt of continuing and helping to keep momentum sticking by the process of the way I was 
        feeling.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        <u>Improving your process with reflection-</u><br>
        Reflection helped solidify concepts in my head and also helped me remember what I had learnt to then use further.
