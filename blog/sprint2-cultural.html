        <h2 class="content-title">Long-Term Goal/Career Pathway</h2>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            To be working for (but not limited to) a tech company where I can apply and grow my skills from Dev Academy. 
            I would love to be a part of big projects which will make a big impact to todays society in some way.
        </p><br>

         <h2 class="content-title">Non-Technical Human Skills To Develop</h2>
         <p class="content-paragraph">
            A big thing I would like to learn and take away (non-technical) is how to effectively time manage when coding. I can at times see 
            myself getting lost in the rabbit hole and struggle to know when and where to draw the line. 
         </p><br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <h2 class="content-title">Strengths and Limitations Description</h2>
            <p class="content-paragraph">
                I feel I have great communication skills, people skills and tend to grasp tech concepts well. However with limitations, I 
                can struggle getting lost in perfecting what I am trying to achieve, at times I can be sensitive to the way things are 
                communicated to me, and I like to make others problems mine too.
            </p><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 class="content-title">Commiting to Manage</h2>
        <ul class="content-paragraph" style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li>-Keeping to the time box suggestions</li><br>
            <li>-A dairy to plan out my days ahead of time</li><br> 
            <li>-Communicate my progress regularly to other learner/facilitators and industry representatives especially when I have hit a bump</li><br> 
            <li>-Not take things personally when it comes to work related aspects</li><br>   
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content-title">Seeking Assistance</h2>
        <ul class="content-paragraph" style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li>-At first instance I will review my work and try and figure out the matter myself and read over instructions and seek online resources. </li><br>
            <li>-Failing that I will seek help from fellow students as they may have come across the issue I am facing.</li><br>
            <li>-Failing that I will seek help from a facilitator to senior.</li><br>
            </ul><br>
        <br> 
        <h2 class="content-title">Expectations from the Facilitation Team</h2>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            They explain issues clearly and certain aspects are broken down where needed, to grasp difficult concepts. I would expect that 
            someone would be accessible during normal working hours to ask questions and work around issues.
