            <p class="content-paragraph">
                Tolerant – Protagonists are true team players, and they recognise that that means listening to other peoples’ opinions, 
                even when they contradict their own. They admit they don’t have all the answers, and are often receptive to dissent, 
                so long as it remains constructive.
                <br>
                <br>
                Reliable – The one thing that galls Protagonists the most is the idea of letting down a person or cause they believe in. 
                If it’s possible, Protagonists can always be counted on to see it through.
                <br>
                <br>
                Charismatic – Charm and popularity are qualities Protagonists have in spades. They instinctively know how to capture an audience, 
                and pick up on mood and motivation in ways that allow them to communicate with reason, emotion, passion, restraint – 
                whatever the situation calls for. Talented imitators, Protagonists are able to shift their tone and manner to reflect the needs of 
                the audience, while still maintaining their own voice.
                <br>
                <br>
                Altruistic – Uniting these qualities is Protagonists’ unyielding desire to do good in and for their communities, be it in their own 
                home or the global stage. Warm and selfless, Protagonists genuinely believe that if they can just bring people together, they can do 
                a world of good.
                <br>
                <br>
                Natural Leaders – More than seeking authority themselves, Protagonists often end up in leadership roles at the request of others, 
                cheered on by the many admirers of their strong personality and positive vision.
                <br>
                <br>
                Protagonist weaknesses
                Overly Idealistic – People with the Protagonist personality type can be caught off guard as they find that, through circumstance or 
                nature, or simple misunderstanding, people fight against them and defy the principles they’ve adopted, however well-intentioned they 
                may be. They are more likely to feel pity for this opposition than anger, and can earn a reputation of naïveté.
                <br>
                <br>
                Too Selfless – Protagonists can bury themselves in their hopeful promises, feeling others’ problems as their own and striving hard to 
                meet their word. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin, and be left unable to help anyone.
                <br>
                <br>
                Too Sensitive – While receptive to criticism, seeing it as a tool for leading a better team, it’s easy for Protagonists to take it a 
                little too much to heart. Their sensitivity to others means that Protagonists sometimes feel problems that aren’t their own and try to 
                fix things they can’t fix, worrying if they are doing enough.
                <br>
                <br>
                Fluctuating Self-Esteem – Protagonists define their self-esteem by whether they are able to live up to their ideals, and sometimes ask 
                for criticism more out of insecurity than out of confidence, always wondering what they could do better. If they fail to meet a goal or 
                to help someone they said they’d help, their self-confidence will undoubtedly plummet.
                <br>
                <br>
                Struggle to Make Tough Decisions – If caught between a rock and a hard place, Protagonists can be stricken with paralysis, imagining all 
                the consequences of their actions, especially if those consequences are humanitarian.

            <p class="content-paragraph">
                Clear Communication - COMMUNICATION
                Communication is a big aspect for me as it can make a message come across with a positive or negative outlook and results is now I or 
                others react to the way the communication was put. Not only this but knowing when to communicate also can make a big impact of a 
                person - eg. Letting someone know well in advance to they can prepare/make arrangements. 
                Keeping others in-mind with my communication is something I think deeply about. The way I convey it is also another consideration. 
                Lastly I play back the scene in my head and try understand the response I’m going to get (based on how I know that person/if I know them). 
                This may mean that I tweet my communication or sometimes even decide for/against communicating what I had intended. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Living a balanced life - BALANCE 
                This ones a big one for me and I think too much of one this isn’t good therefore “balance” is key and I feel it can be applied to a lot 
                of things in my life. Eg. Eating - healthy vs unhealthy, lifestyle - working vs leisure, financially - splurging vs saving.
                <br>
                <br>
                Leaving space for change - FLEXIBILITY
                Being flexible for change has helped me a lot with some of my stresses in life. Always at the back of my head knowing that anything could 
                change at anytime and being ready to accept change has  allowed me to be openminded towards other and events in my life. Besides, everything 
                has its positives and negatives - nothing is ever entirely good (positive) or entirely bad (negative).

                the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took</strong></h2>
            <p class="content-paragraph">
                One of my close friends had (in a very upset way) communicated a few things that I had done (which effected them) that they didn’t 
                like. When that came across to me, it was very unconstructive and didn’t  address the matter entirely. Upon some thinking it was not 
                a very respectful way to communicate and totally against my value of communication. I dislike confrontation and just wanted to let it 
                pass however, deep inside I kept telling myself “this was not ok and I need to address the matter”.  I later decided to approached 
                them regarding the matter and expressed how I felt. How I communicated the way I felt had to be appropriate as well. As a result of 
                they were able to become aware of how I felt and I came to the realisation that they didn’t really intend to make me feel the way they 
                did, but had a terrible day that day and the frustration had come out on me. Things were ironed out and we could move past the matter.

           <h2 class="content-title"><strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</strong></h2>
           <p class="content-paragraph">
            My culture has influenced my values and identity in a way that has built the way I perceive the world and how I interact with people on a 
            day to day basis. My understanding of cultural influence is that - it is passed down from my parents and makes me the person I am today. 
            Being Indian, I have had to find a balance of influence that consider my roots being Indian and also living/being raised in a western 
            society in New Zealand. Somewhere in the middle of these two is where I sit comfortably to function. Based on this, I am able to derive 
            the above personal values and identity.

          <h2 class="content-title"><strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</strong></h2>
          <p class="content-paragraph">
            Being Indian, my opinion is that everything is based on what people say and think about us or how we are perceived in the 
            community. This naturally makes it harder to be my true self when around others. So sometimes I ended up doing thing I don’t 
            truly enjoy but would do it for others or for a status of acceptance. As i grew older, this mindset started to have major 
            clashes with making my personality bold and unique true to myself the way I wanted to be. I was force to make a stand for who 
            I wanted to be and the things I enjoyed/disagreed with. This meant accepting that others may not always think of you in a 
            good/positive light. But this was ok and it’s more important to be my true self.  On the other end of the scale, my culture has 
            taught me an immense amount of respect for others and our elder peers as well as altruistic qualities.

          <h2 class="content-title"><strong>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</strong></h2>
          <p class="content-paragraph">
            Strengths
            Thinking of my strengths in the learning/career perspective - one exceptional talent I feel I possess is the ability to be tolerant of 
            others around me. Regardless of what others might be saying or instructing me as a senior - I can express my concerns/thoughts if I 
            think it is necessary but still accept any situation even if it doesn’t go my way (in reason of course) and move on. I have an ability 
            to feel the mood or situation and can adapt my persona in a manner that helps me fit in or know what I can/can’t say. I consider myself 
            very punctual and reliable meaning that my work is done to a high standard and ticking all the criteria/timelines. Should this not be 
            achievable, at first inkling I like to make it apparent to my seniors. 
            <br>
            <br>
           <br>
            Weakness/Limitations   
            In some cases making big decisions can seem in obstacle for me as I can doubt myself or have less confidence that I’m making the right 
            decision. I get  lost in making something overly perfect and sometimes don’t see that my mistakes can also lead me to learning and 
            becoming a better person. Others problems can sometimes feel like my own and although being able to put myself in others shoes I can 
            struggle to know when to stop myself or draw the line.
