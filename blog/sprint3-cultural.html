    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        Emotional intelligence is being able to understand, use and manage your own emotions in a positive light to relive stress, communicate effectively, 
        empathise with others, overcome challenges, succeed at tasks and work, and achieve career/personal goals. It can also be helpful to help connect with 
        your feelings, turn intent to action, and make informed decisions/choices about things that matter.

    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        IQ (intelligence quotient) a score one can achieve by taking a standardised test which is designed to evaluate intelligence.  
        Whereas EQ (emotional	quotient) is the ability to evaluate/control emotions. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="content-title"><strong>Why is it important?</strong></h1>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
        EQ is directly linked with resilience and therefore that may mean - our ability to engage/interact with challenges, maintain/sustain performance, 
        ‘bounce back’ swiftly from adversity, and learn/grow from experiences. With developed EQ, it makes ‘coping with stress’ or ‘stressful conditions’ 
        more manageable and makes it possible to maintain a positive outlook! Chances are that eventually we are likely to burn out at some stage as it is normal 
        to continually push ourselves or be pushed by our seniors/pairs as part of growing. It is therefore important to have sound EQ as a way of dealing with 
        moments of self-doubt or negativity towards ourselves or other around us.
